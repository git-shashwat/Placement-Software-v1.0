# Placement-Software-v1.0
I developed this project to ease out the working of my collegeâ€™s placement cell by performing the following tasks on a Master Database Excel sheet which usually contains over **600+ records**: 

1. Students' placement record **Database Parsing** which includes:
* Setting homogenity in fields such as Enrollment Numbers, Date of Birth.
* Reducing data redundancy and Duplicacy particularly in contact details.
2. **Refining Parsed Database** based on the company profile:
* Based on the Company's Requirements such as B.Tech %, Backlogs, 12<sup>th</sup> % etc. , the parsed Database then undergoes a process of sorting and filtering of records.
* The Refined Database is then stored in a [Company_Name].xlsm format in the local directory for easy access later.
3. **Database Preview**: Once the records are refined, user can navigate to the *Preview* section of the software to take a look at the generated Database.

4. **Email Notifications** to selected/filtered students: User can access the *send e-mail* section of the software to send 
E-mails to the students to notify them about interview details from the software itself.
